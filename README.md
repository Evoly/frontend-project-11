# RSS Aggregator
The RSS Aggregator is a web-based application designed to consolidate and display content from multiple RSS feeds in a unified interface.

## Key Features  
- **Feed Management**: Add or remove RSS feeds by submitting their URLs.  
- **Automatic Updates**: Regularly checks for new content (default: 5-second intervals).  
- **Unread Post Tracking**: Visually distinguishes between read and unread entries.  
- **Content Preview**: Displays post summaries in a modal window without external navigation.  
- **Structured Architecture**: Implemented using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for maintainability.
